# 1. Introduction

## Introduction
Initial concept originally introduced in 2008 by (anonymous) Satoshi Nakamoto to provide a solution to double-spending problem
* **Defintion**:
  * peer-to-peer, fault-tolerant, decentralized ledger system that records all transactions across a network of computers

* **Key Characteristics**:
  * Immutable: Once recorded, data cannot be altered
  * Transparent: Transactions are visible to all participants
  * Decentralized: No central authority
  * Secure: Uses cryptographic techniques for security
  * Consensus: Agreement among participants on the validity of transactions

## Development of Blockchain

* Blockchain 1.0: Cryptocurrency
  * permissionless, public blockchains
  * main use case: digital currency
* Blockchain 2.0: Smart Contracts
  * lack of scalability and privacy in Blockchain 1.0
  * Ethereum introduced smart contracts
  * main use case: trade finance, supply chain management, digital ownership
* Blockchain 3.0: Decentralized Applications (DApps)
  * extension of Blockchain 2.0 allowing for decentralized applications
  * blockchain-based applications that run on a peer-to-peer network
* Onwards:
  * Blockchain in industry and governments (IoT, healthcare, finance, etc.)
  * Interoperability between blockchains 
  * Scalability solutions (sharding, sidechains, etc.)
  * Privacy improvements (zk-SNARKs, etc.)

  
## Relevance and Use Cases
* Financial Services:
  * Cross-border payments
  * Decentralized finance (DeFi)
* Supply Chain Management:
  * Transparency and traceability
  * Counterfeit prevention
* Healthcare:
  * Patient data management
  * Drug traceability
* Other applications:
  * Voting systems
  * Digital identity
  * Intellectual property rights
  * Real estate
  * Energy trading
