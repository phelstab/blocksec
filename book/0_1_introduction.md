# Introduction

## Introduction
Initial concept originally introduced in 2008 by (anonymous) Satoshi Nakamoto to provide a solution to double-spending problem {cite}`bitcoinhistory:online,bitcoin:article`
* **Defintion**:
  * peer-to-peer, fault-tolerant, decentralized ledger system that records all transactions across a network of computers {cite}`Glaser2017_1000073702:inproceedings`

* **Key Characteristics**:
  * Immutable: Once recorded, data cannot be altered
  * Transparent: Transactions are visible to all participants
  * Decentralized: No central authority
  * Secure: Uses cryptographic techniques for security
  * Consensus: Agreement among participants on the validity of transactions

## Development of Blockchain

* Blockchain 1.0: Cryptocurrency {cite}`vokerla:inproceedings`
  * permissionless, public blockchains
  * main use case: digital currency
* Blockchain 2.0: Smart Contracts
  * lack of scalability and privacy in Blockchain 1.0
  * Ethereum introduced smart contracts
  * main use case: trade finance, supply chain management, digital ownership
* Blockchain 3.0: Decentralized Applications (DApps)
  * extension of Blockchain 2.0 allowing for decentralized applications
  * blockchain-based applications that run on a peer-to-peer network
* Onwards:
  * Blockchain in industry and governments (IoT, healthcare, finance, etc.) {cite}`9086611:article`
  * Interoperability between blockchains 
  * Scalability solutions (sharding, sidechains, etc.)
  * Privacy improvements (zk-SNARKs, etc.) {cite}`Nitulescu2020zkSNARKsAG:inproceedings`

  
## Relevance and Use Cases
