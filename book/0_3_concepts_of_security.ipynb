    "### 3.1.1 Cryptographic Hash Functions\n",
    "Because the concept of blockchains is built on different aspects of computation theory, cryptography, and distributed computing, we will start with the core aspects that form a blockchain and begin with the *cryptographic hash functions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a more uncommon approach in science, but we want to first define what properties our hash functions must hold so they can be used in common blockchains, and we will understand the \"Why?\" later when everything comes together. {cite}`narayanan2016bitcoin`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computation\n",
    "**Computational Property 1: *Input Flexibility***\n",
    "  * The input can be any string of any size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational Property 2: *Fixed-Sized Output***\n",
    "  * The function produces a fixed-sized output.\n",
    "  * For this discussion, a 256-bit output size is assumed, but the property holds for any sufficiently large output size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational Property 3: *Efficient Computability***\n",
    "  * The hash function is efficiently computable, meaning that for a given input string, the output can be determined in a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "  * Technically, computing the hash of an n-bit string should have a running time of O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cryptography\n",
    "**Cryptographic Property 1: *Collision Resistance***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** A hash function \\( H \\) is said to be collision resistant if it is infeasible to find two values, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), such that \\( x \\neq y \\), yet \\( H(x) = H(y) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why we need this?* \n",
    "  * We need collision resistance to ensure that it is infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.\n",
    "  * This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing forgery.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* \n",
    "  * When a transaction is created, it is hashed to produce a transaction ID.\n",
    "  * If an attacker could find two different transactions that produce the same hash (collision), they could potentially replace a legitimate transaction with a fraudulent one without being detected.\n",
    "  * This would undermine the integrity of the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cryptographic Property 2: *Hiding***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** A hash function \\( H \\) is said to be hiding if, when a secret value \\( r \\) is chosen from a probability distribution that has high min-entropy, then, given \\( H(r \\parallel x) \\), it is infeasible to find \\( x \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why we need this?* \n",
    "  * We need the hiding property to ensure that given a hash output, it is infeasible to determine the original input.\n",
    "  * This is essential for preserving the confidentiality of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* \n",
    "  * The hiding property ensures that the nonce and other block header data cannot be easily deduced from the hash output.\n",
    "  * Maintains the difficulty and security of the mining process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cryptographic Property 3: *Puzzle Friendliness***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** A hash function \\( H \\) is said to be puzzle friendly if for every possible \\( n \\)-bit output value \\( y \\), if \\( k \\) is chosen from a distribution with high min-entropy, then it is infeasible to find \\( x \\) such that \\( H(k \\| x) = y \\) in time significantly less than \\( 2^n \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why we need this?* \n",
    "  * Puzzle friendliness ensures that solving the hash function requires a brute-force search.\n",
    "  * Prevents shortcuts and maintains the security of cryptographic protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "  * In Bitcoin mining:\n",
    "    * Miners must find a nonce such that the hash of the block header concatenated with the nonce produces a hash with a certain number of leading zeros.\n",
    "    * Puzzle friendliness ensures there are no shortcuts to finding this nonce.\n",
    "    * Maintains the difficulty and security of the mining process.\n",

    "* **Derivation path**: ```m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index```\n",
    "    * **Purpose**: constant set to 44' (or 0x8000002C) to indicate the following path is according to BIP44\n",
    "    * **Coin Type**: constant representing a particular cryptocurrency (e.g., 0' for Bitcoin, 1' for Testnet)\n",
    "    * **Account**: index of the account (0-indexed)\n",
    "    * **Change**: 0 for external addresses (used for receiving funds) and 1 for internal addresses (used for change)\n",
    "    * **Address Index**: index of the address (0-indexed)\n",
