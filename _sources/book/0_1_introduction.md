# Introduction

<h2 style="text-align: center">
Blockchain - the all-purpose weapon, just a buzzword or hacker's paradise?
</h2>

## Agenda

* Overview of blockchain technology
* Security aspects & technical fundamentals
* Blockchain attack vectors
* Hands-on exercises

## Overview

<div class="alert alert-info"><b>INFO</b><br />
Initial concept originally introduced in 2008 by (anonymous) Satoshi Nakamoto to provide a solution to double-spending problem
</div>

* **Definition**:
  * peer-to-peer, fault-tolerant, decentralized ledger system that records all transactions across a network of computers {cite}`bitcoinhistory:online,bitcoin:article,Glaser2017_1000073702:inproceedings`

* **Key Characteristics**:
  * Immutable: Once recorded, data cannot be altered
  * Transparent: Transactions are visible to all participants
  * Decentralized: No central authority
  * Secure: Uses cryptographic techniques for security
  * Consensus: Agreement among participants on the validity of transactions

## Development of Blockchain

* Blockchain 1.0: Cryptocurrency {cite}`vokerla:inproceedings`
  * permissionless, public blockchains
  * main use case: digital currency
* Blockchain 2.0: Smart Contracts
  * lack of scalability and privacy in Blockchain 1.0
  * Ethereum introduced smart contracts
  * main use case: trade finance, supply chain management, digital ownership
* Blockchain 3.0: Decentralized Applications (DApps)
  * extension of Blockchain 2.0 allowing for decentralized applications
  * blockchain-based applications that run on a peer-to-peer network
* Onwards:
  * Blockchain in industry and governments (IoT, healthcare, finance, etc.) {cite}`9086611:article`
  * Interoperability between blockchains 
  * Scalability solutions (sharding, side chains, etc.)
  * Privacy improvements (zk-SNARKs, etc.) {cite}`Nitulescu2020zkSNARKsAG:inproceedings`

  
## Relevance and Use Cases
* Financial Services:
  * Cross-border payments
  * Decentralized finance (DeFi)
* Supply Chain Management: {cite}`9076162:article`
  * Transparency and traceability
  * Counterfeit prevention
* Healthcare:
  * Patient data management
  * Drug traceability
* Other applications:
  * Voting systems
  * Digital identity
  * Intellectual property rights
  * Real estate
  * Energy trading {cite}`MENGELKAMP2018870:article`
